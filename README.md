## Motivation:

I wanted to create a game to re-enforce the knowledge I gained over past 6 weeks in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I decided to create Trivia game as it provides an opportunity for me to experiment with APIs & for players to gain knowledge on the topics they are intereseted.

## How to play the game:
Users can either proceed to play with default catergory of 'General Knowledge' or select some other category of their interest and difficulty level
